                        <span> What is Coding?</span> <br>
                        <p>Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.

                            </p>

                        <span> How Coding Works?</span><br>
                        <p>  To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do. To go a bit deeper, computers don’t understand words. They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a computer are guided by on and off switches, or transistors. Binary code represents these on and off transistors as the digits 1 and 0. An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your computer work. In order to make binary code manageable, computer programming languages were formed. These languages each serve different purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate important commands into binary code.

                        <span>Is Learning to Code Difficult?</span><br>
                        <p> Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time and effort to learn. Coding gets an unnecessarily bad reputation from people who weren’t persistent enough to practice. The easiest coding languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s a tiny sliver in comparison to learning a spoken foreign language. Once the easier languages are mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn other ways to code. Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug computer applications

                        <span>Popular Coding Languages to Learn</span><br>
                        <p>                        <span>Java</span> – Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java has English-based commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites. Java is a popular favorite for programming mobile apps and video games, especially on Android operating systems.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>Python </span>– Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python has a simple, English-like syntax to script back-end actions for applications, user interfaces, and operating systems that work well. Many platforms, including Google and NASA’s Integrated Planning System, use Python.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span> CSS </span> – CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style. Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS tells internet browsers each page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape, and more. Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>C Language</span> – C Language is a simple, low-level coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system. Perhaps the easiest language, C has just 32 basic keywords used for scripting embedded systems, network drivers, and artificial intelligence. C language is versatile to get computer hardware communicating.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>C++ </span>– C++ is another object-oriented programming language that expands on C to execute higher-level computer tasks. Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs. Adobe, Microsoft Office, Amazon, and Mozilla software utilizes C++ for fast processing.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>PHP</span> – PHP, or hypertext processor, is a coding language for web development founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. PHP is widely used for server scripting with HTML to piece together dynamic website content. WordPress, an open-source online platform that accounts for 20 percent of websites and blogs, is notably written with PHP.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p><span>SQL</span> – SQL, or structured query language, is a domain-specific coding type that streams information into a database. First introduced by IBM researchers in 1974, SQL has simple syntax to run back-end web databases. SQL is used by most businesses to load, retrieve, and analyze text or numbers in their servers
